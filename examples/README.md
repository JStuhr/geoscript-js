GeoScript JS Examples
=====================

The example scripts in this directory are intended to demonstrate how discrete,
real-world tasks can be carried out with GeoScript.

Setup
-----

The example scripts require the same data that the tests rely on.  Before 
running the examples, create a data directory in this examples directory and
extract the test data.  This can be accomplished by running the setup.js script 
in this same directory.
