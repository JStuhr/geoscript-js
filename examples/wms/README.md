WMS Example
===========

This example application provides a very bare bones 
[Web Mapping Service](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) 
implementation.  It is not intended to be a fully compliant WMS, but rather as 
a demonstration of map rendering with GeoScript.

Setup
-----

This application relies on the same data as the other examples.  See the main
readme file in the examples directory for setting up the example data.


Starting the Application
------------------------

Launch the WMS application by running the main.js script.

    ringo examples/wms/main.js

You should now be able to browse to a page displaying 
[your map](http://localhost:8080/).
